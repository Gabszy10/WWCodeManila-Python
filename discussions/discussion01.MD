## Variables

Let's try to store some values!

Open a terminal

```shell
Windows: Click Start -> Type cmd
Mac: Open Applications folder -> Utilities folder
```

After opening the terminal/command prompt(cmd), type the following command to run the Python shell:

```shell
python
```

Type the following codes to create variables and to print their values!

```shell
num = 88
dec = 99.99
is_wwc_great = True
has_forever = False
print(num, dec, is_wwc_great, has_forever)
```

Now, let's try if we can re-assign values for these variables.

```shell
num = 100
has_forever = True
print(num, dec, is_wwc_great, has_forever)
```

## Arithmetic Operations

Let's try to do some arithmetic operations using Python!

Still using the Python shell, type the following codes and check their results.

```shell
20 + 10
20 - 10
20 * 10
20 / 10
9 // 2
10 // 3
4 ** 2
10 % 3
99 % 33
```

## Keyboard Input

Let's ask user's for an input!

Still using the Python shell, type the following codes, answer the input and see the output!

```shell
name = input('Your name:')
tweet = input('Tweet your day:')
print(f'{name} tweeted {tweet}')
```
