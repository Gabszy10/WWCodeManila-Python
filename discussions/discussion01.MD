## Variables

Let's try to store some values!

Open a terminal

```shell
Windows: Click Start -> Type cmd
Mac: Open Applications folder -> Utilities folder
```

After opening the terminal/command prompt(cmd), type the following command to run the Python shell:

```shell
python
```

Type the following codes to create variables and to print their values!

```python
num = 88
dec = 99.99
is_wwc_great = True
has_forever = False
print(num, dec, is_wwc_great, has_forever)
```

Now, let's try if we can re-assign values for these variables.

```python
num = 100
has_forever = True
print(num, dec, is_wwc_great, has_forever)
```

## Arithmetic Operations

Let's try to do some arithmetic operations using Python!

Still using the Python shell, type the following codes and check their results.

```python
20 + 10
20 - 10
20 * 10
20 / 10
9 // 2
10 // 3
4 ** 2
10 % 3
99 % 33
```

## Keyboard Input

Let's ask user's for an input!

Still using the Python shell, type the following codes, answer the input and see the output!

```python
name = input('Your name:')
tweet = input('Tweet your day:')
print('{} tweeted {}'.format(name, tweet))  # String formatting replaces {} with variable values
# print(f'{name} tweeted {tweet}')  # New string formatting added on Python3.6
```

## Challenge

Let's apply what you have learned! For this topic's challenge:

Aling Nenaâ€™s Sari-sari store wants a robot that will ask the
customer their total bill and payment amount and tell them their change
(for now, we can allow negative change). For example:

```shell
>> How much is your total bill? 150
>> How much is your payment? 200
>> Hi! Your change is 50.00
```

Just some notes:
* Under exercises01, you can use and copy `exercise01.py` as template.

```shell
Git project -> exercises -> exercises01 -> exercises01.py
```

* Please rename the file as `<first name initial><middle name initial><last name>_execise01.py`. For example, John M. Doe will name his file as `jmdoe_exercise01.py`.
* Share your work and contribute to the community! Please request membership to one of our GIT groups: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/wwcodemanila) or [GitHub](https://github.com/wwcodemanila) 
* Please upload or push the file in our GIT repository (either in GitHub or GitLab) under the exercise folder.
* Present your work in front (#ApplaudHer)! You can also share your study group experience in social media and tag us!
