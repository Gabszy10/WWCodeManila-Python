# Git and GitHub Resources

We know your hands are getting itchy and wants to continue typing on some Python codes.
In the first place, you attended our study group to learn Python and wait.... you are redirected
to a page to learn this three letter word, `git`.

Just believe in us! Later on your tech career you will thank us for introducing Git.

## Why Git

Git is a helpful tool for code backup, version control/tracking and code sharing!

Aside from these, we in the Python study group wants you to use Git so that:

* You can share your work to your peers or your employer ;P
* If you work on an exercise on a workday and need help, we can easily view your codes

## Getting Started

If you have done few exercises, you may have:

- [X] Created a GitHub account
- [X] Created `wwcode-python` repository
- [X] Uploaded some exercises on your `wwcode-python` repository

Now, we want you to deep dive into GIT!

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io)
- [WWCode Manila GIT Party Slides](https://github.com/wwcodemanila/git-party)
- Install Git on your machine

## Challenge

For your succeeding exercises, we want you to upload your work by using `git` instead of the upload button!

1. Clone your `wwcode-python` repository

```
git clone [url]
```

or

2. Update your `wwcode-python` repository

```
git pull
```

3. Add your exercise file

```
git add [file]
```

4. Push your changes

```
git push
```
