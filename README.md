# Welcome to the world of Python!
For beginners, we will learn the basic concepts of
programming using Python. This can be your jump off towards web development,
scripting, data processing and more!

For immediate/advanced Pythonistas, let's spread our knowledge of Python and learn more!

If you have questions, please feel free to ask and participate on our [discussion
board](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Manila/messages/boards/forum/24115536).

## Study Group Setup
* Resources such as notes, exercises and samples will be uploaded here.
* Our 1.5 hours will be divided randomly into:
    - Introduction/Getting to know first-timers
    - Discuss questions/issues raised on discussion board
    - Lightning Talk (anyone who wants to share/chikka something!)
    - Self-paced or mini study session
    - Today I Learned (TIL)
    - Announcement
