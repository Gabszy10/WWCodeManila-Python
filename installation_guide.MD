## Getting started
We need Python first! For our study group, we will be using `Python 3`, preferably `Python 3.6` :)

To check if Python is already installed, open your terminal or command prompt.
- For Windows users, search for `cmd`
- For Linux and Mac users, search for `terminal`

After opening the terminal/command prompt(cmd), type the following command.
```shell
python --version
```

or

```shell
python3 --version
```

This will tell you what version of python is currently installed in your computer.

```shell
Python 3.6.0

```
> If python 3 is already installed, skip the next part.

For a detailed installation process, please [use this tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/).

> Note for Windows user, please don't forget to add Python in your PATH as per below.

Done! You can now start coding in Python!
