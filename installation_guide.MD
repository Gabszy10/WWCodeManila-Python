## Getting started
We need Python first!

Open your terminal or command prompt.
- For Windows users, search for `cmd`
- For Linux and Mac users, search for `terminal`

After opening the terminal/command prompt(cmd), type the following command.
```shell
python --version
```

This will tell you what version of python is currently installed in your computer.

```shell
Python 3.6.0

```
> If python 3.6 is already installed, skip the next part.

We will be using `python 3.6` for this tutorial. You can download the [installer here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Once download is complete, run the installer and follow the steps.

For more detailed installation process, please [use this tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/)

Done! You can now start coding in Python!
