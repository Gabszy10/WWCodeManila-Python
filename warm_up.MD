## Let's do some warm up

Now we will run a very basic Python program that will print `Hello WomenWhoCode!`

#### Copy sample file

Please copy the `first_python_code.py` file under `samples` folder.

```
Git project -> samples -> first_python_code.py
```


#### Running your first Python program

Let's try to run some code.
- Open a terminal

```
Windows: Click Start -> Type cmd
Mac: Open Applications folder -> Utilities folder
```
- Go to the directory of the repository by running the following command.

```
cd <path_to_repo>
```
- You should see a file called `first_python_code.py`. This is your simple program that prints some text.
- Run it by typing the following command.
- 
```
python first_python_code.py
```
- The output should be
- 
```
Hello WomenWhoCode!
Hello WomanWhoCode!
Hello WomenWhoCode!
```
- Open the file using your text editor to see the code.

#### Try printing your name
- Inside the file, there is an instruction. Follow it! :)
- When you are done, save the file and go back to the terminal
```
python first_python_code.py
```

Now you have run your first program!
