# Let's Learn Flask!

Our `Hello World` Flask application might have get you excited and trust us, it's
just the tip of the iceberg. 
We will be using TutorialsPoint Flask [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/index.htm)
to learn some basic Flask concepts. At the end, the skills you gained will allow
you to create your `random quote generator` web application!

## Notes

Though TutorialsPoint has only introduced `virtualenv`, 
you can still use `virtualenvwrapper` to manage your virtual environments.
